Known Bugs
1. cannot save a ticket without saving content -- is this a bug? or as expected?
2. logout functionality not working?  
    -- security related message?  
    -- perhaps a firewall issue due to work computer?  
    -- test on a different laptop
3. nav bar - after timeout of token, a admin loses the users menu.  
    -- maybe due to logout now working properly?
4. when admin adds a comment to a user ticket, it still logs the original user on the content record.
